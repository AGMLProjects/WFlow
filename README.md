## The mission

Saving water and gas is not only beneficial for our bank accounts. We need to leverage on the average user consumes through a continuous analysis and monitoring of its habits. This can be decisive for our environment’s future… which is our future. <br>
But how can **WFlow** help in this mission? <br>
WFlow is an **IoT ecosystem** which comprehends a set of sensors and actuators dynamically tied to a main device, acquiring and managing the user’s water and gas **consumption data**. <br>
Through our WFlow **mobile application**, those data are easily accessible from all around the world, allowing the user to keep track of its consumption habits and manage them directly to **avoid waste**. <br>
The user can also agree to gather information for our global API, which can be accessible for **global statistics** such as geographical analysis, allowing also its water and gas supplier to better manage resources distribution, resulting in even further savings. <br>
